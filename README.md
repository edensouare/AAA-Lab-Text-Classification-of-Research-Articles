The AAA Lab is preparing a meta-analysis investigating how users develop trust in AI systems and the potential risks of overreliance
on AI-driven decisions. To facilitate this study, I developed a machine learning (ML) program designed to streamline the literature
review process. The program processed a dataset of over 5,000 academic articles, automatically filtering and categorizing relevant
papers based on predefined keywords (e.g., "artificial intelligence" OR "chatbot" OR "LLM" OR "large language model" OR "conversational agent")
AND ("addiction" OR "overuse" OR "overreliance" OR "excessive use" OR "dependence" OR "problematic use"). This tool significantly reduced the
manual effort required for preliminary screening, enabling researchers to
focus on high-impact studies for deeper analysis.
